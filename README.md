# Google-Store-Sales-Analysis-

Overview
“The 80/20 rule has proven true for many businesses–only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. As such, marketing teams are challenged to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies” (https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction/overview). So, for our final project we are getting the data from Kaggle. This data includes the Google Merchandising data from Google Analytics Demo Account, which is open for the public to practice Analytics . This is a huge Panel data hence has 1.8 million records. We will be taking a sample from the data to perform our analysis for the business problems mentioned in the first part of the proposal. There are several fields in our data set to help our analysis.
